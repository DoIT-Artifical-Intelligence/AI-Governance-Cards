# 👋 Welcome to the GitHub for AI in Maryland, or MDAI!
The State of Maryland [responsibly, ethically, and productively leverages AI](https://doit.maryland.gov/policies/ai/Pages/maryland-responsible-ai-policy.aspx) to improve constituent outcomes and reduce drudgery for the State workforce. We achieve this goal by: 
* [Publishing standards](https://doit.maryland.gov/policies/ai/Pages/AI-governance-card-gemini-workspace.aspx) for responsible, ethical AI use throughout MD State government on topics like using GenAI.
* [Building foundations and momentum for AI](https://innovate-us.org/partner/marylanddoit) via office hours, a community of practice, and free training for Maryland's civil service.
* [Incubating AI pilots](https://doit.maryland.gov/policies/ai/Pages/maryland-AI-enablement-strategy-and-roadmap.aspx) across Maryland state agencies, then helping teams embed these pilots into their tech stacks.
* [Shipping open source AI tools](https://github.com/DoIT-Artifical-Intelligence/colab-ytt-to-docs/blob/main/Colab_YouTube_Transcription_Extractor_And_Summarizer.ipynb) for anyone to use in Maryland and beyond.

# MDAI's Tenets
* 🛳️ **Deliver, don't delay**
  * We have a bias for action to get usable tools, policies, artifacts, and outcomes in our partners' hands. 
* 🔍 **Show, don't tell**
  * We work with peers across Maryland state government to show them what AI can do, from notetaking to process improvement. 
* 🔗 **Partner, don't gatekeep**
  * Our grounding in ethical, responsible AI use gives us the foundation to share how agencies can weave this work into their own fabrics.
* 🤝 **Empathize, don't assume**
  * Done right, AI improves lives. MDAI's team grounds our work in scalable user needs to have the biggest possible impact.
 
MDAI works in the open to inspire trust in our work and champion our belief that AI is for everyone. 📧 [Welcome](AI@maryland.gov)!
